# desserts

## <ins>Overview</ins>
This is Rebecca Kauper's test project for the Fetch iOS apprenticeship application. The app fetches and displays dessert recipes from [TheMealDB API](https://themealdb.com/api.php). The app retrieves data from the following endpoints: 
 - Recipes in the "dessert" category: https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?c=Dessert
 - Dessert details: https://themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/lookup.php?i=MEAL_ID

The app displays a grid listing the desserts (image and name) sorted alphabetically. Tapping a dessert takes the user to the *Dessert Detail* page, where they can view the dessert name, ingredients/measurements, and recipe instructions.

## <ins>Download and run</ins>
- This app is written in SwiftUI.
- The project requires Xcode version 15.4.
- The minimum depoyment target is iOS 17.5.
